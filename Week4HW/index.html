          <li class = "btc"> <h3>Bitcoin</h3></li>

            <ol>
              <li>Bitcoin can be used as a savings vehicle. With large price fluctuations, Bitcoin may not seem to be a smart way to save money at first glance. But, since it's inception over 10 years ago, Bitcoin's price has increased 200% per year on average. With the top banks offering savings rates of .5% per year, it becomes clear why so many people have looked elsewhere to save money, and many people have landed on Bitcoin. </li>
              <li>Bitcoin is a hedge against inflation. It is called a "Hard Money", which means that it cannot be created by any central power. In the US, 40% of all dollars in circulation have been printed in the last year and a half. In the past, this type of increase in money supply has been a precursor to inflation. Becuase Bitcoin's supply is set by code, instead of political policy, it can be a great alternative for anyone wanting to store money in something besides paper currency that is prone to inflation.</li>
              <li>Trying to understand how bitcoin has value can be difficult to understant. <a href = "https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100314/why-do-bitcoins-have-value.asp" >Here is a link</a> to an article that explains exactly why Bitcoin is valueable.</li>
            </ol>


          <li class = "eth"> <h3>Ethereum</h3></li>

            <ol>
              <li>Ethereum is a cryptocurrency platform that has it's own currency called "ETH". As Bitcoin is viewed of as "digital gold", ETH has been compared to "digital oil".</li>
              <li>As a platofrorm, Ethereum utilizes smart contracts, and the ETH cryptocurrency is used to interact with these smart contracts. <a href ="https://ethereum.org/en/smart-contracts/" >Here is a link</a> to an explanation of Smart Contracts on Ethereum's offical website.</li>
              <li>Ethereum is also a platform that is used for creating NFTs. NFTs are a way to insert almost any item into a token that is unique and impossible to copy, the most well known NFTs are for digital art (<a href = "https://opensea.io/">Open Sea</a> is a great place to check out popular NFTs), but the real world applications for NFTs are endless.</li>
